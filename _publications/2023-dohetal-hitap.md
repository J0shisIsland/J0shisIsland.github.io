## Abstract  

How can older residents in assisted living and inpatient care facilities
participate in digital education and social activities? This is the aim of the German interdisciplinary research project “Digital Educational Processes for Older Residents in Assisted Living Arrangements and Care Facilities” (DiBiWohn). Central to the project is a peer mentoring concept, in which older volunteers are trained as technology volunteers who assist in the learning process of digital technology novices from the aforementioned institutions. The paper first describes the project and the peer-to-peer concept. Then, findings from a nationwide online survey conducted in the spring of 2021 with n = 171 active technology volunteers (M = 70.4 years, 60–89 years) are presented, including everyday use of digital media, digital competencies, and attitude towards technology. The findings are related to a comparison group with n = 160 persons (M = 70.4 years, 60–90 years) who are equally educated, but do not volunteer in the field of technology. Inferential statistical analyses are applied to identify relevant determinants of Internet self-efficacy in both groups. The findings emphasize that information and communication technologies, such as the Internet and smartphones, are already used on a daily basis in both groups. However, the level of digital competencies and self-efficacy is significantly higher among the active technology volunteers. They thus represent “digital best agers” who have the prerequisites to be learning companions and role models for older people who are inexperienced in digital technologies.
